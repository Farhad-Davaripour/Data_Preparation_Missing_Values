### Overview
* * *
This repository presents a step by step approach to manipulate the missing values in a data frame. The following steps are carried out including
* replacing the missing values (? in here) with np.nan
* finding the columns which includes missing values and counting the number of cells with missing values
* replacing the missing values with the average of the values in the column  

The following steps are also carried out in order to prepare the data for data analysis:
* normalizing the values based on the (value - average(value))/standard_deviation
* binning the columns into categorical groups (e.g., low, medium, and high)
* Turning categorical variables into quantitative variables (e.g., 0 and 1)
