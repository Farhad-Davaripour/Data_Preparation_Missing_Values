### Overview
* * *
This repository presents a step by step approach for data wrangling, and descriptive statistical analysis. The following steps are carried out to address the missing values in the dataset, including:
* replacing the missing values (? in here) with np.nan
* finding the columns which include missing values and counting the number of elements with missing values
* replacing the missing values with the average of the values in the column  

The following steps are also taken in order to prepare the data for data analysis:
* normalizing the values based on the (value - average(column))/standard_deviation(column)
* binning the columns into categorical groups (e.g., low, medium, and high)
* Turning categorical variables into quantitative variables (e.g., 0 and 1)

Finally, statistical descriptive analyses are performed using:
* Chi-Square and analysis of variance (ANOVA) methods for columns with object data type
* Pearsonr method for columns with numerical data type
